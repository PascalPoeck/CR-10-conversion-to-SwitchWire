# CR-10-conversion-to-SwitchWire

You will find here all the files needed to upgrade your Creality CR-10/CR-10S to a Voron Switchwire. This is an on-going project, far from being finished so be patient. <br />
<br />
There is 2 folder inside the Skirt, one containing all non modified files (original Trident Skirt) and another one containing the files I modified in Fusion 360 to fit the CR-10 frame.
<br />
<br />
I also created on my website a blog post about this project. You will find more info there and also the Fusion 360 view of the beast ;)

# About the skirt
<br />
The skirt is a combination of the Trident 250 and the Trident 350 original skirt. To fit the frame of the CR-10 I had to create some custom parts. 
<br />
For the front side and the back side, I modified only the middle piece to make it smaller by removing a few cm from the middle so the honeycomb remains aligned with the left and right parts.
<br />
For the sides of the frame I create new parts, except for the middle part that must be the same as original to fit the 6020 fans. I choose also to mount them backwards so the honeycomb stays aligned with the honeycomb from the center part.
<br />
I'm using the same rubber feet as the Trident. You can find them easily on Internet. I took mine on AliExpress for $7 ^^

# About the Core XZ
<br />
After working on the skirt I finished the Core XZ part and it's seems to work as expected. All the printed parts are the same as the one on Voron's Github. 
Note that the Key Back doesn't fit because the cable is too short so I will change it later with the alternative proposed on Voron Mods. 
Also I had to shorten the X 2020 to keep the belt aligned propely.
I'm curently printing an sourcing the parts for the Stealthburner but I'm not sure I will keep this one, will see later as well.
Next step is to work on the Y axes and electronics.
