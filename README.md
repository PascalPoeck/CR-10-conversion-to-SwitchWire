# CR-10-conversion-to-SwitchWire

You will find here all the files needed to upgrade your Creality CR-10/CR-10S to a Voron Switchwire. This is an on-going project, far from being finished so be patient. <br />
<br />
There is 2 folder inside the Skirt, one containing all non modified files (original Trident Skirt) and another one containing the files I modified in Fusion 360 to fit the CR-10 frame.
<br />
<br />
I also created on my website a blog post about this project but it's in French. The only part that could be interesting for you is the Fusion 360 view ;)
