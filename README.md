# CR-10-conversion-to-SwitchWire

You will find here all the files needed to upgrade your Creality CR-10/CR-10S to a Voron Switchwire. This is an on-going project, far from being finished so be patient. <br />
<br />
There is 2 folder inside the Skirt, one containing all non modified files (original Trident Skirt) and another one containing the files I modified in Fusion 360 to fit the CR-10 frame.
<br />
<br />
I also created on my website a blog post about this project but it's in French. The only part that could be interesting for you is the Fusion 360 view ;)

# About the skirt
<br />
The skirt is a combination of the Trident 250 and the Trident 350 original skirt. To fit the frame of the CR-10 I had to create some custom parts. 
<br />
For the front side and the back side, I modified only the middle piece to make it smaller by removing a few cm from the middle so the honeycomb remains aligned with the left and right parts.
<br />
For the sides of the frame I create new parts, except for the middle part that must be the same as original to fit the 6020 fans. I choose also to mount them backwards so the honeycomb stays aligned with the honeycomb from the center part.
<br />
I'm using the same rubber feet as the Trident. You can find them easily on Internet. I took mine on AliExpress for $7 ^^
